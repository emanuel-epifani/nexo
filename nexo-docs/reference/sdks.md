# Client SDKs

Official client libraries for connecting to Nexo from your application.
All SDKs provide the same unified API to access Store, Pub/Sub, Queue, and Stream brokers.

## Versioning

The Nexo server and all SDKs share the **same version number**. If the server is at `v0.3.0`, install SDK `v0.3.0` — same version means guaranteed compatibility. New SDKs (e.g. Python) will start at whatever version the server is at when they are released.
